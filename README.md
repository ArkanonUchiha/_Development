# _Development

This is a personal monorepository of tests that contains everything from simple and easy exercises to slightly more complex projects.

**commit syntax example:**

```markdown
  (FILES: bases.js, arrays-longitud.js, borrando-propiedades-de-objetos-delete.js): console outputs are added in exercise files. [ROOT FOLDER: breves-ejercicios]
```
