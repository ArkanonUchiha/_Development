# _Development

This is a personal monorepository of tests that contains everything from simple and easy exercises to slightly more complex projects.

**Commit Syntax Example: When the modified files are at the root folder level.**

```markdown
  (FILES: bases.js, arrays-longitud.js, borrando-propiedades-de-objetos-delete.js): console outputs are added in exercise files. [ROOT FOLDER: breves-ejercicios]
```

**Commit Syntax Example: When modified files are located within multiple folders.**

```markdown
  (FILES: README.md, UI/index.js): The README file in the root folder has been updated and The location path of the card images has been corrected [ROOT FOLDER: root, first-vite-app]
```
